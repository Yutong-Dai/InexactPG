streamed lined tests for adpative v.s. schimdt 
using projected subgradient decent method

for each inner proximal subproblem; the maximum allowed iteration is set to 5e5.

No safeguard versus schimdt

projection threshold based on the minimal non-zero-norm of the proximal point / or prespecified number
